# lfq-hello
     
It is the first time that I have created a repository and a branch .
And I found that I am so lazy that I dont want to read the guide called hello-world.    
Luckily,I compel myself to read the passage with a good attitude and now I can know github gradually.   
I am so happy!     
And now I can just know a little about C and php and sql injection,I'll try my best to learn more.
